## Why Use TypeScript?
---
* Identifies many hard to find errors before the code gets executed
* Static analysis allows for enhanced tooling support
  * Refactor names across entire codebase
  * Code completion and inline documentation
  * Inline error highlighting
* Encourages more robust code architecture - makes it harder to break things
* Self-documenting

Note: Avoid use of type `any` to get these benefits
